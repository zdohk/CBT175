            based on job card CPU time, TCAM queue usage, how many tape
            drives a job uses, and the submitter of the job.  Two user SMF
            records are produced, a SMF 247 record for TCAM queue usage and a
            SMF 248 record for PROC usage.
   NAPJ006  Usermod to install J2XIT09 - JES2 Exit 9 to handle lines exceeded

            /*JOBPARM LINES= lines, started tasks get unlimited lines and the
            $HASP375 message is suppressed for the report management system
            until it exceeds 2.5 million lines of output. Note that the EXIT 10
            mentioned in the comments in the exit has not been implemented but
